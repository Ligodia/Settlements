Things To Add:

- Each Settlement have ranks other than just the Leaders and Settlers (similar to how Towny has 'helper', 'vip', and other customised ranks).

- Should SettlerController have a constructor that allows you to add a Map already? When a server restarts I assume this would be needed?
  ^ Same for SettlementController with it's HashMap of settlements.

  
  
What commands do we want? I expect we'll need a Skype call for this.

Also, we need to sort out how plots are going to work.
I presume making an object would be the best way to do it.

Do we want a founder to also be a leader? 'Might' increase efficiency when checking whether a player is a leader, instead of checking whether they are a founder or leader? 
It's probably a pretty minor change to be honest.
